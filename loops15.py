# Take an integer input in a variable named n. 
# Take user input as many times as the value of n.

# Finally, print the sum of all those numbers which you have taken as an input.

# Example: If the user has put n value as 6, then take input for 6 times.

# n=int(input("Enter the num:"))
# i=1
# sum=0
# while i<=n:
#     num=int(input("Enter the num:"))
#     sum=sum+num
#     i+=1
# print(sum)
